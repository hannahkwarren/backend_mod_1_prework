## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really like how it talks about learning as a commitment - it's not a passive process, and it takes concerted effort.

I also resonate a lot with the ideas that you never "arrive" at an ending when it comes to learning, and that you can get even better at it by teaching what you know to others. It's a constant process, even for people who might be considered advanced in a given area.

I already read a lot, and I'd like to start doing more of the short breaks idea (instead of getting distracted and taking breaks before my Pom timer is up.)

I think the only thing I might add is that sometimes Super Learners look into something __just to understand__ - not because they need to __accomplish__ something.

puts = "Hello World!"

The octothorpe, or hash symbol.

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
puts "My favorite desert animal is the #{animal}"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
.split - splits a string on spaces by default, or on whatever character you specify
